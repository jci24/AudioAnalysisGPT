# AcousticGPT — Product, Architecture, Roadmap & Scrum Reference Prompt

You are my senior product manager, innovation strategist, software architect, acoustic engineering advisor, and scrum master.

I am building a project called **AcousticGPT**.

AcousticGPT is an AI-assisted sound analysis platform where users can analyze audio/signal data manually, but also interact with an AI agent that helps them understand the signal, detect problems, compare products, suggest next analyses, and generate evidence-based conclusions.

This document should be treated as the product and technical reference for the project. Whenever you help me generate code, architecture, user stories, tasks, acceptance criteria, technical specs, or sprint plans, use this context.

# 1. Product Vision

AcousticGPT should not be just:

> "ChatGPT next to a spectrogram."

The goal is to build:

> **An AI-assisted acoustic investigation and benchmarking platform.**

The product should help users move from raw sound data to understanding, comparison, diagnosis, decision-making, and reporting.

The main idea:

```text
Import sound data
→ run reliable DSP analysis
→ extract structured evidence
→ detect findings
→ let the AI agent explain and investigate
→ compare products/signals
→ suggest next steps
→ generate reports
```

The AI should behave more like a junior acoustic engineer or investigation copilot, not like a generic chatbot.

## Application Modes

The UI supports two main workspaces:

1. **Manual Analysis Mode** — Traditional signal inspection with file list, waveform, spectrum, spectrogram, comparison, and analysis inspector panels. Inspector starts collapsed by default. The waveform stays pinned full-width; analysis/tool panels tile in a responsive 2-column grid below it (Option C "constrained tiled grid"). Each tool panel can toggle between normal (1 column) and wide (full row); open panels + their span persist to `localStorage` (`acousticcanvas.manualAnalysis.toolPanels`). A shared frequency cursor (`analysisCursor` Redux slice) links the frequency-domain panels: hovering the spectrum draws a frequency guide on the spectrogram and vice-versa, and the CPB panel highlights the band containing the cursor frequency (and emits its band-center frequency on hover). The same slice also carries a shared time cursor: hovering the waveform draws a vertical time guide on the spectrogram and vice-versa.
2. **Agent Analysis Mode** — Chat-based interaction with an AI agent that can invoke analysis tools and produce deterministic workspace artifacts.

### Backend Analysis Details

**Level Analyzer:**
- Per-channel: min, max, peak, RMS, DC offset
- dB conversions with configurable reference
- Crest factor calculation
- Multi-channel averaging

**Spectrum Analyzer:**
- FFT size: configurable (default 8192)
- Window: Hann
- Overlap: 50%
- Scaling: one-sided amplitude, coherent-gain corrected
- Averaging: power-based
- Output: columnar arrays (FrequenciesHz[], Magnitudes[], MagnitudesDb[])

**Spectrogram Analyzer:**
- Adaptive frame capping (max 1000 frames)
- Frequency scales: linear, mel, log
- FFT: default 2048, overlap 75%
- Gain range: −10 to +30 dB, dynamic range: 20–120 dB
- Output: byte-normalized (0–255) frames, base64 encoded

**Comparison Engine:**
- Multi-file pairwise analysis
- Pre-computed deltas: peak, RMS, crest factor, frequency differences
- Named frequency bands: sub (20–80 Hz), low, low_mid, mid, presence, high, air (10–20 kHz)
- Band energy deltas computed server-side
- **Psychoacoustic comparison**: `CompareSoundQuality` (loudness/sharpness/roughness) per file + `CompareSoundQualityDelta` (B−A + winner fields) in pairwiseDiffs; when unavailable, compare returns explicit `soundQualityUnavailableReason` at file and pairwise levels for graceful degradation
- **Agent evidence**: `EvidencePackageBuilder` emits `sound_quality_comparison` evidence item when ≥2 files have SQ metrics; agent can cite per-metric deltas as benchmark evidence

**Event Detection:**
- Clipping: ≥0.99 FS, ≥2 consecutive samples
- Silence: ≤−40 dBFS, ≥100 ms (EBU QC 0078B)
- Loudest region: 500 ms window with max RMS
- Transient: fast-onset detection
- Returns AudioEvent[] with start/end times, description, metadata

**Findings Engine:**
- Orchestrates level analysis + all 4 event kinds per file
- Generates structured Finding records: type, severity, confidence, evidence, time/freq location, suggestedNextStep
- Current finding types: `clipping`, `silence_gap`, `high_crest_factor`, `dc_offset`, `tonal_peak`
- Severity: `low` | `medium` | `high`; Confidence: `observed` | `inferred`
- Finding IDs are sequential short keys (`finding_001`, `finding_002`) — no path leakage
- Pure static logic in `FindingsEngine.cs` — no dependencies, deterministic

### Signal Domain Model

```csharp
SignalChannel {
    Id, Name, SampleRate, SampleCount,
    Quantity ("digital_amplitude"), Unit ("FS"),
    DbReference (value, unit, dBUnit),
    CalibrationInfo (isCalibrated, scale, offset),
    Samples (float[])
}
```

### Redux Store Structure

| Slice | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `navigation` | activeMode, activeFileId, activeView |
| `project` | projectName, files[], selectedSignalId, markers[], visibleViews[] |
| `waveformSelection` | startSeconds, endSeconds, loopEnabled |
| `analysis` | Level analysis result + status |
| `spectrum` | Spectrum result + user parameters |
| `spectrogram` | Spectrogram result + user parameters |
| `chat` | messages[], isThinking, selectedModel, evidenceReferences/evidenceItems/limitations on assistant messages |
| `agentWorkspace` | artifacts[], focusedArtifactId, expandedArtifactIds |
| `findings` | FindingsResult, status, error |

### Agent Tool System

The agent has two parallel execution paths:

**Old frontend tool loop** (workspace mutations — markers, selections, views, reports):

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `getState` | Query current workspace state |
| `analyze` | Run analysis (file_info, level, spectrum + semantic kinds) |
| `compare` | Compare two files/regions |
| `find` | Detect events (clipping, silence, clicks) |
| `workspace` | Manipulate workspace (markers, selections, views) |
| `report` | Generate markdown reports |

**Backend orchestrator** (`POST /api/agent/ask` — investigative questions):

| Tool | Purpose | Artifact type |
|------|---------|---------------|
| `get_metadata` | File duration, sample rate, channels, bit depth | `tool_result` |
| `run_basic_metrics` | Peak, RMS, crest factor | `tool_result` |
| `run_event_detection` | Clipping/silence/transient events | `tool_result` |
| `run_spectrum` | FFT peak frequency + dominant peaks | `tool_result` |
| `run_spectrogram` | Full-file spectrogram time-frequency summary | `tool_result` |
| `run_cpb` | Octave/1⁄3-octave band levels | `tool_result` |
| `run_sound_quality_metrics` | Loudness, sharpness, roughness | `tool_result` |
| `run_findings` | Full findings pipeline (clipping, silence, crest, DC offset, tonal peaks) | `findings_result` |

Routing: `questionRouter.ts` dispatches investigative keywords → orchestrator; workspace action keywords → old tool loop.

All orchestrator tool outputs are forwarded to the frontend via `ToolResultsData` in `AgentAskResult`. The backend also returns `EvidenceReferences` and `EvidenceItems`, so chat citations can reference backend evidence separately from workspace artifact IDs. The frontend (`useAgentAsk`) creates workspace artifacts for every completed tool, stores evidence metadata on assistant messages, and renders compact evidence pills in chat. Clicking an evidence pill focuses the matching workspace artifact by evidence type and file ID; detail cards remain expanded after the temporary focus highlight clears.

Agent file targeting: explicit `@fileName` mentions in chat narrow `selectedFileIds` to the mentioned file(s). If no file is mentioned, the Agent falls back to all loaded files for multi-file analysis.

Agent behavior questions: meta-questions such as "why did you analyze both?" are answered directly without running DSP tools.

Agent method questions: definitions or conceptual questions such as "what is a spectrogram?", "what does CPB mean?", or "how is roughness measured?" should be answered with `no_analysis_needed` unless the user explicitly asks to analyze loaded audio. Data questions such as "what does the spectrogram show for @file.wav?" should still run the relevant deterministic tool. No-tool answers must clear/remove any planning bubble and must not show malformed generic next steps.

Agent spectrogram artifacts: multi-file `run_spectrogram` results create one workspace artifact per file, so each spectrogram evidence pill focuses the matching file-specific artifact instead of a combined card.

Agent spectrogram answer contract: compact spectrogram evidence supports duration, displayed range, Nyquist/frequency coverage, FFT size, scale, frame count, and bin count. It does not expose per-frame energy coordinates, bright-line positions, dominant bands over time, complexity, harmonic richness, or transient timestamps to the final-answer model. Duration/frame count describe time coverage/resolution only; they must not be used to infer broader frequency range or richer/less complex content. For burst/transient questions, the planner should pair `run_spectrogram` with `run_event_detection(kind="transient")`; for explicitly spectrogram-only comparisons, it should not add FFT spectrum unless peaks/tonal balance are also requested.

Semantic analysis kinds available (old loop): loudness, peaks, dynamics, spectral_balance, noise, stereo_phase, distortion, dialogue_clarity.

# 3. Strategic Positioning

The product should not compete only as a plotting tool.

Existing tools already provide strong plotting and analysis features:

- HEAD acoustics ArtemiS SUITE
- HBK / BK Connect
- Siemens Simcenter Testlab
- Listen Inc SoundCheck
- MATLAB / Python workflows
- REW / Audacity for simpler analysis
- Internal company scripts and tools

AcousticGPT should differentiate through:

1. AI-assisted investigation
2. Evidence-based findings
3. Batch product comparison
4. Sound quality interpretation
5. Benchmarking workflows
6. Human-readable explanations
7. Suggested next analyses
8. Reproducible reports
9. Project memory
10. Ability to compare many products/signals/settings

The strongest product direction is:

> **AI benchmark intelligence and acoustic investigation for product sound teams.**

---

# 4. Target Users

Primary target users:

- Sound quality engineers
- Acoustic engineers
- NVH engineers
- Audio engineers
- Product sound teams
- R&D engineers
- Test engineers
- Consumer product engineers
- Hearing-aid/audio-device engineers
- White-goods sound-quality teams
- Consultants working with sound and vibration

Do not target "everyone who uses audio" at the beginning.

Avoid building a generic audio editor.

The first strong use cases should be professional sound analysis and comparison.

---

# 5. Example High-Value Use Cases

## Use Case 1 — Product Sound Comparison

A user imports recordings from several product versions.

The app should answer:

- Which product is louder?
- Which product is sharper?
- Which one has tonal peaks?
- Which one has more impulsive events?
- Which product sounds more annoying?
- What evidence supports that conclusion?

## Use Case 2 — Hearing-Aid Product Benchmarking

A user from a hearing-aid company wants to compare 100 products, settings, or firmware versions.

The app should support:

```
100 products/settings
→ same input test signals
→ output recordings
→ batch metrics
→ ranking
→ clustering
→ outlier detection
→ AI explanation
→ report
```

Possible metrics:

- Loudness
- Sharpness
- Roughness
- Fluctuation strength
- Spectrum
- Spectrogram
- CPB / 1⁄3 octave
- Clipping
- Crest factor
- Tonal peaks
- Latency if input/output alignment is available
- Artifact indicators
- Similarity to benchmark/reference

The agent should explain trade-offs, for example:

> "Product 42 performs well in speech-like frequency regions but shows stronger high-frequency energy around 4–6 kHz, which may be perceived as sharper or harsher than the reference."

The agent must only say this if the backend has provided supporting evidence.

## Use Case 3 — Acoustic Investigation

The user asks:

> "Why does this recording sound annoying?"

The app should not simply show a plot.

It should investigate:

- Is there clipping?
- Is there a tonal peak?
- Is there a broadband noise increase?
- Are there transient impacts?
- Is sharpness high?
- Is there modulation?
- Is one product worse than the benchmark?
- What analysis should be run next?

## Use Case 4 — Report Generation

The user runs analysis and asks the agent to generate:

- Short engineering summary
- Product comparison report
- Issue list
- Suggested next tests
- Customer-friendly explanation
- Internal R&D report

Reports must be grounded in measured data.

---

# 6. Core Product Principles

## Principle 1 — Evidence Before Explanation

The backend computes facts.
The AI explains facts.
Never let the OpenAI API invent conclusions directly from raw audio.

The correct architecture is:

```
Audio file
→ deterministic DSP / analysis modules
→ structured evidence JSON
→ findings engine
→ OpenAI API
→ explanation / report / suggestions
```

The AI should receive structured information like:

```json
{
  "fileId": "product_b.wav",
  "metadata": {
    "durationSeconds": 12.4,
    "sampleRateHz": 48000,
    "channels": 1
  },
  "basicMetrics": {
    "rmsDbFs": -18.4,
    "peakDbFs": -1.2,
    "crestFactorDb": 14.5,
    "clippingDetected": false
  },
  "spectralFindings": [
    {
      "type": "tonal_peak",
      "frequencyHz": 685,
      "prominenceDb": 11.2,
      "confidence": 0.91
    }
  ]
}
```

Then the agent can say:

> "There is a strong tonal peak around 685 Hz, with 11.2 dB prominence over nearby frequencies. This may explain a perceived whine. A useful next step is to compare this peak against RPM/order data or against a reference recording."

## Principle 2 — Controlled Autonomy for Acoustic Investigation

The agent should not scale by accumulating endless hardcoded rules like "if the user asks X, run tool Y."

The target product behavior is a constrained acoustic investigation system:

```
User question
→ AgentIntentClassifier
→ evidence requirements
→ AgentPlanner
→ ToolPolicyValidator
→ ToolExecutionService
→ EvidencePackageBuilder
→ Findings / HypothesisRanker
→ ActionRecommender
→ AgentResponseValidator
→ grounded answer / report + workspace artifacts + investigation timeline
```

The backend remains responsible for deterministic measurements. The AI may classify intent, plan approved tools, explain evidence, rank hypotheses, and suggest safe next actions, but it must not invent measurements or present unsupported interpretations as facts.

### Agent Intent Layer

Agent requests should first be classified into a small set of explicit acoustic intents:

- `general_diagnosis`
- `compare_files`
- `rank_candidates`
- `explain_perception`
- `detect_specific_issue`
- `suggest_modification`
- `generate_report`
- `ask_method_question`
- `search_external_context`

Intent classification should drive evidence requirements. For example, "why does this sound harsh?" may require sound-quality metrics, spectrum, CPB, and findings; "why did you analyze both?" should be treated as an agent behavior question and should not run DSP tools.

### Evidence Layer

Evidence types should be explicit and reusable across chat, workspace artifacts, findings, reports, and benchmarks:

- `metadata`
- `basic_metrics`
- `spectrum`
- `spectrogram`
- `cpb`
- `sound_quality_metrics`
- `event_detection`
- `findings`
- `reference_comparison`
- `similarity`
- `external_context`

Every evidence item should include file identity, region, parameters, method, limitations, and measured values where applicable. Evidence should remain separate from the final narrative so reports can be reproduced and audited.

### Tool Layer

Tools are approved deterministic capabilities, not arbitrary AI actions. The planner should select tools by required evidence type, and a policy validator should reject unknown, unsafe, or irrelevant tools before execution.

Current and planned tool mapping:

| Evidence needed | Approved tool |
|-----------------|---------------|
| `metadata` | `get_metadata` |
| `basic_metrics` | `run_basic_metrics` |
| `spectrum` | `run_spectrum` |
| `spectrogram` | `run_spectrogram` |
| `cpb` | `run_cpb` |
| `sound_quality_metrics` | `run_sound_quality_metrics` |
| `event_detection` | `run_event_detection` |
| `findings` | `run_findings` |
| `reference_comparison` | `compare_files` |
| `similarity` | Future `run_similarity` |
| `external_context` | Future `search_case_library` / `search_external_context` |

### Safe Action Layer

Agent autonomy must be bounded by action safety:

| Level | Action type | Policy |
|-------|-------------|--------|
| 1 | Read-only analysis tools | Safe to run automatically |
| 2 | View/navigation actions visible to the user | Safe when reversible and visible |
| 3 | Non-destructive preview actions | Allowed only as temporary previews |
| 4 | Destructive, external, or project-changing actions | Require explicit user confirmation |

Examples of Level 4 actions include deleting files, overwriting reports, exporting externally, uploading audio to a third-party service, changing project calibration, or applying permanent processing.

### Hypothesis Layer

The agent should rank possible explanations from evidence instead of jumping to a single confident answer. Responses should distinguish:

- Measured facts
- Inferred hypotheses
- Unsupported explanations
- Limitations
- Suggested next tests

Example: a tonal peak near 1 kHz is a measured fact; "likely perceived as a whine" is an inferred hypothesis; "caused by motor order X" is unsupported unless RPM/order data or reference context exists.

### External Knowledge Policy

External context is allowed only with strict boundaries:

- Internet or standards context is not measured evidence from the user's audio.
- Use external sources for standards, specifications, definitions, and background, not for invented objective benchmark claims.
- Prefer local curated case libraries and validated references before open internet search.
- Do not upload user audio externally without explicit confirmation.
- If external context is used, cite it separately from measured audio evidence and state its limitations.

### Autonomy Modes

The product should support explicit autonomy modes:

- **Explain only** — answer from already available evidence; do not run new tools.
- **Assistive autonomy** — preferred default; run safe read-only analysis tools and explain what was used.
- **Proactive investigation** — run a broader approved investigation suite and propose next tests.
- **Strict approval** — ask before every tool/action.

The default should be assistive autonomy: the agent can run Level 1 read-only analysis, produce evidence-backed hypotheses, and suggest next actions, while leaving destructive/project-changing work to explicit confirmation.

Current implementation already has important pieces of this architecture: `AgentPlanner`, `AgentToolRegistry`, `ToolExecutionService`, `EvidencePackageBuilder`, and `AgentResponseValidator`. Future agent work should make the intent classifier, tool policy validator, hypothesis ranker, action recommender, and investigation timeline explicit rather than adding isolated prompt rules.

## Principle 3 — Findings, Not Only Chat

The app should have a structured **Findings Panel**.

Examples of findings:

- Clipping detected
- Tonal peak detected
- High sharpness
- Loudness difference
- Broadband noise increase
- Transient impact
- Outlier recording
- Similar to reference
- Different from benchmark
- Suspicious high-frequency energy
- Possible modulation
- Possible artifact

Each finding should include:

- Finding type
- Severity
- Confidence
- Evidence
- Time location, if relevant
- Frequency location, if relevant
- Suggested next step
- Related plot or analysis

## Principle 4 — Reproducibility

Every result must be reproducible.

For every AI conclusion, store:

- Input file
- Analysis module used
- Parameters used
- Computed metrics
- Finding ID
- Agent prompt/context
- Agent answer
- Evidence used

No hidden calculations. No fabricated values. No placeholder values presented as real analysis.

## Principle 5 — Batch Comparison Is a Key Differentiator

A major differentiator is the ability to compare many sounds at once.

The product should support:

- 10 files → 50 files → 100 files
- Product families
- Firmware versions
- Settings
- Reference vs candidate products
- Before/after comparison
- Ranking, clustering, outlier detection
- Report generation

This is more commercially interesting than single-file analysis.

## Principle 6 — Keep the Product Narrow at First

Do not build: a DAW, a generic audio editor, a music-production tool, a generic chatbot, a MATLAB clone, a full replacement for enterprise NVH platforms.

Start with:

> Professional sound analysis, comparison, and AI-assisted interpretation.

# 7. Technical Architecture

## Frontend

React + Mantine + Redux Toolkit + wavesurfer.js

Frontend responsibilities:

- Display data
- Let user choose analysis
- Show loading/error/empty states
- Show analysis parameters
- Show evidence used by agent
- Send user requests to backend
- Never fabricate metrics
- Never perform critical heavy DSP

### Key UI Surfaces

| Surface | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Manual Workspace | File list + waveform + resizable analysis panels |
| Agent Workspace | Chat panel + artifacts panel |
| Spectrum Panel | FFT visualization with user parameters |
| Spectrogram Panel | Time-frequency heatmap |
| Comparison View | Overlaid spectra + metrics table + band energy |
| Analysis Inspector | Multi-channel level metrics grid |
| Transport Controls | Play/pause/seek/loop |

## Backend

.NET 8 + FastEndpoints + MathNet.Numerics + NAudio

Backend responsibilities:

- Audio file orchestration
- Project state
- File metadata extraction
- Audio loading/decoding
- DSP pipeline (level, spectrum, spectrogram, comparison, events)
- Finding generation
- OpenAI API orchestration (infrastructure ready)
- Python sidecar orchestration for CPB and sound-quality metrics
- Result caching (future)
- Export/report data (future)

### File Storage

Local filesystem: `AudioStorage/` directory with 12-character GUID filenames.

### Playback

In-memory `ConcurrentDictionary` for playback state. Commands: play, pause, seek, stop.

## Python Sidecar (Active)

Installed packages (system Python 3.13 at `C:\Users\JCASTRESANA\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python313\python.exe`):

- `mosqito==1.2.1` — psychoacoustic metrics (loudness, sharpness, roughness)
- `PyOctaveBand==1.2.2` — fractional octave filter bank
- `scipy`, `numpy 2.4.6`, `numba`, `llvmlite`, `pyuff` — installed as dependencies

Executable path configured in `appsettings.Development.json` under `PythonSidecar:Executable`.

Implemented uses:

- CPB `python_filter_bank` method through a subprocess sidecar
- MoSQITo stationary loudness and DIN sharpness through a subprocess sidecar

Planned uses:

- MoSQITo for additional sound-quality metrics (fluctuation strength)
- Scientific libraries
- Audio embedding models
- ML inference
- Prototype algorithms before porting to C#

Important:

- Do not tightly couple the whole product to Python.
- Treat Python-based analysis as replaceable plugins.
- Define clean contracts between C# and Python.
- Handle Python errors clearly.
- Avoid blocking the UI while Python tasks run.

## MoSQITo / Sound Quality

Strategy:

- Use MoSQITo for first-pass stationary loudness, sharpness, and roughness.
- Keep uncalibrated values explicitly labelled as relative-comparison metrics until calibration metadata maps samples to physical sound pressure.
- Consider native C# implementations only where the standard and validation fixture set are clear.
- Keep the interface generic so another engine can replace it later

Example abstraction:

```csharp
public interface ISoundQualityAnalysisService
{
    Task AnalyzeAsync(
        AudioSignalReference signal,
        SoundQualityAnalysisParameters parameters,
        CancellationToken cancellationToken);
}
```

## OpenAI API Layer

**Current state**: Fully connected. The frontend tool loop dispatches tool calls, collects results, and sends conversation context to `POST /api/agent/chat`. The backend (`OpenAiChatService`) injects the system prompt, forwards to OpenAI (gpt-4o-mini), and returns the response. The API key is stored server-side in `appsettings.Development.json` (gitignored) or in the backend process environment variable `OPENAI_API_KEY`.

Security rule: never put OpenAI keys in frontend `.env` files or any `VITE_*` variable. Vite exposes `VITE_*` values to browser code and debug output.

OpenAI API is used for:

- Explanation
- Interpretation
- Report generation
- Suggested next steps
- Comparing results
- Summarizing findings
- Answering user questions grounded in measured evidence

- ✅ Crest factor
- ✅ Clipping detection (≥0.99 FS, ≥2 samples)
- ✅ DC offset
- ✅ Silence detection (≤−40 dBFS, ≥100 ms)

## Spectral Analysis ✅ DONE

- ✅ Named band energy deltas (7 bands: sub → air)

## CPB Analysis 🟡 PARTIAL

- ✅ Octave bands
- ✅ 1⁄3 octave bands
- ✅ Region-aware CPB graph
- 🟡 Current method: FFT-bin power summation into nominal fractional-octave bands
- ✅ CPB comparison between files via existing compare workflow
- ✅ CPB comparison UX shows the largest band deltas first, with the full band table below
- ✅ Agent compare/report artifacts can cite strongest CPB band delta
- ✅ Z / A / C weighting controls with explicit weighting metadata
- 🟡 Standards-oriented filter-bank mode via Python sidecar scaffold (`python_filter_bank` method selector + subprocess client); generated 1 kHz and 100 Hz sine fixture validation done, external calibrator/standards validation pending
- ❌ CPB over time

Future method roadmap:

- Keep `fft_bin_power_sum` as the fast interactive diagnostic CPB mode.
- `python_filter_bank` exists as an experimental subprocess sidecar path with generated sine fixture tests; validate it against known external calibrator files before standards claims.
- First candidate library: `PyOctaveBand` (MIT; fractional octave filter bank, A/C/Z weighting, time weighting).
- Secondary candidates: `pyfar` fractional octave filters, `pyfilterbank` fractional octave filter bank.
- Do not claim IEC 61260 compliance for the current C# FFT-bin implementation; label it as nominal FFT-bin CPB analysis.

## Sound Quality Metrics 🟡 PARTIAL

- ✅ Stationary loudness via MoSQITo `loudness_zwst`
- ✅ DIN sharpness via MoSQITo `sharpness_din_st`
- ✅ Daniel-Weber roughness via MoSQITo `roughness_dw`

# 11. Suggested Next Priorities (after current state)

Given the current state, the recommended next work is:

1. ~~Connect OpenAI API~~ ✅ Done
2. ~~Findings Panel~~ ✅ Done — Structured findings from event detection + level analysis
3. ~~Tonal peak detection~~ ✅ Done — Local prominence heuristic in spectrum analyzer + findings
4. ~~CPB analysis~~ 🟡 Partial — Backend + manual CPB panel, comparison, Z/A/C weighting controls, experimental `python_filter_bank` sidecar path, and generated-WAV validation tests done; external calibrator validation pending
5. ~~Sound quality metrics: loudness + sharpness + roughness~~ ✅ First slice done — MoSQITo sidecar, backend endpoint, manual panel, direct metric imports, and generated-WAV validation
6. ~~Agent findings investigation flow~~ ✅ Done — `run_findings` wired into orchestrator; `findings_result` and `tool_result` workspace artifacts; compact evidence citation pills focus matching artifacts and keep detail cards expanded; markdown rendering
7. ~~Python packages installed~~ ✅ Done — `mosqito==1.2.1`, `PyOctaveBand==1.2.2` installed in system Python 3.13; sidecar path configured
8. ~~Sound-quality comparison~~ ✅ Done — Loudness/sharpness/roughness deltas are included in A/B comparison UI, pairwise diffs, and agent evidence
9. **Next UX/UI iteration** — Turn the current analysis workspace from "many panels" into a clearer guided investigation flow before adding more large feature surface
10. **Next: Batch benchmarking** — Add multi-file ranking, clustering, outlier detection, and report-ready benchmark summaries

## UX/UI Review Backlog — Added 2026-06-10

The product is directionally strong: it feels like a technical acoustic investigation tool, not a generic chatbot or DAW. The main UX risk is that the interface can feel like a collection of analysis panels rather than a guided workflow from file import to evidence, interpretation, and next action.

### Critical UX Tasks

1. **Agent response status clarity**
   - Problem: Long-running agent analysis can feel stalled if the user only sees a generic loading state.
   - Why it matters: Trust drops quickly when analysis status is ambiguous, especially for MoSQITo and multi-file workflows.
   - Target pattern: One assistant bubble per request with visible user-facing activity states: planning, running tools, building evidence, generating answer, failed.
   - Acceptance criteria:
     - A request never shows duplicate temporary assistant bubbles.
     - The active assistant bubble shows the current status.
     - Final answer, evidence, next steps, and errors appear in that same bubble.
     - Long-running tools show a clear tool/activity label.

2. **Guided investigation workflow**
   - Problem: After loading a file, users may not know whether to open tools, read findings, ask the agent, or inspect plots.
   - Why it matters: New users need a clear next action; expert users need faster triage.
   - Target pattern: File loaded -> suggested analyses -> key findings -> evidence-backed next actions.
   - Acceptance criteria:
     - Empty or sparse workspace states suggest the next useful analysis.
     - Findings and key summaries are visually prioritized over raw controls.
     - Agent and manual workflows point to the same evidence model.

### Important UX Tasks

3. **Manual analysis layout hierarchy**
   - Problem: Panels can feel scattered across a large canvas and relationships between findings, spectrum, spectrogram, CPB, and sound quality are not always obvious.
   - Why it matters: Users need to scan and compare results quickly.
   - Target pattern: Keep the responsive grid, but strengthen hierarchy with a primary result area, key findings, and consistent secondary panels.
   - Acceptance criteria:
     - The default manual workspace has an obvious first reading path.
     - Panel headers, controls, and results use consistent sizing and spacing.
     - Empty regions are replaced with meaningful placeholders or recommended next steps.

4. **Reusable analysis result card pattern**
   - Problem: Different panels present controls, method metadata, key takeaways, and visualizations differently.
   - Why it matters: Inconsistent presentation increases cognitive load and makes the product feel less polished.
   - Target pattern: Each analysis card has title, compact controls, key takeaway, visualization, method/limitations, and evidence hooks.
   - Acceptance criteria:
     - Spectrum, CPB, sound quality, findings, and comparison cards share a recognizable structure.
     - Key metric/takeaway text is more visually prominent than configuration metadata.
     - Method and limitation details remain available without dominating the card.

5. **Tool discoverability and click targets**
   - Problem: Icon-only or narrow tool controls can be unclear; users may not know whether icon, label, or row is clickable.
   - Why it matters: Tool invocation is core to the workflow.
   - Target pattern: Full-row clickable tool items with icon, label, active state, hover state, and tooltip.
   - Acceptance criteria:
     - Clicking either icon or label triggers the same tool action.
     - Active/open tools are visually distinct.
     - Every non-obvious icon has a tooltip.

6. **Readability and visual polish**
   - Problem: Some secondary labels, timestamps, and metadata can be too faint; panel density and blank space are uneven.
   - Why it matters: Low contrast and inconsistent density reduce trust and slow scanning.
   - Target pattern: Stronger text contrast, consistent panel rhythm, and fewer ultra-muted labels outside disabled states.
   - Acceptance criteria:
     - Secondary text is readable on laptop displays.
     - Disabled states are visually distinct from ordinary metadata.
     - Panel padding, header height, borders, and control sizing are consistent.

### Nice-To-Have UX Tasks

7. **Metric education without clutter**
   - Problem: Loudness, sharpness, roughness, CPB, and spectrogram settings can be opaque to non-expert users.
   - Why it matters: Users need enough context to trust and interpret metrics without turning the UI into documentation.
   - Target pattern: Tooltips, compact "what this means" affordances, or expandable method notes.
   - Acceptance criteria:
     - Help text is available on demand.
     - Always-visible UI remains focused on results and next actions.

8. **Usability validation script**
   - Problem: UX assumptions need validation before heavy engineering investment.
   - Why it matters: The product direction is specialized; real user behavior matters.
   - Validation tasks:
     - "You uploaded a WAV file. What would you click first?"
     - "Find why one file sounds harsher than another."
     - "Tell me what evidence supports the agent answer."
     - "Find the sound-quality metrics."
     - "Compare two files and identify the biggest difference."
     - "Explain what the current finding means."
     - "Identify which controls are clickable."
     - "Tell me when the app feels stuck or unclear."

# 15. Scrum Master Guidance

## Sprint Length

1-week sprints while the product is uncertain.

## Definition of Ready

A story is ready when it has:

- User persona
- User value
- Input/output expectations
- Acceptance criteria
- Edge cases
- Backend contract
- Frontend behavior
- Testing expectations
- Known assumptions

## Definition of Done

A story is done when:

- Feature works end-to-end
- Backend has tests for calculations/contracts
- Frontend handles loading/error/empty states
- Analysis values are reproducible
- Agent answers are grounded in real data
- No fake placeholder values remain
- User-facing labels are understandable
- Assumptions are documented

## Sprint Planning Rule

Always prefer a thin vertical slice.

Good vertical slice:

```
Import WAV → compute RMS/peak/clipping → display metrics → agent explains clipping result
```

Bad approach:

```
Build huge architecture for all future metrics before one full feature works.
```

## Backlog Prioritization (updated for current state)

1. ~~Reliable file import~~ ✅
2. ~~Basic metrics~~ ✅
3. ~~Spectrum/spectrogram~~ ✅
4. ~~A/B comparison~~ ✅
5. ~~Connect OpenAI API for agent explanations~~ ✅
6. ~~Findings panel~~ ✅
7. ~~Tonal peak detection~~ ✅
8. ~~CPB analysis~~ 🟡 Partial
9. ~~CPB comparison~~ ✅
10. ~~CPB weighting controls~~ ✅
11. ~~Standards-oriented CPB filter-bank mode via Python sidecar scaffold~~ 🟡
12. ~~Generated-WAV CPB sidecar validation tests~~ ✅
13. ~~Sound-quality metrics: loudness + sharpness + roughness~~ ✅ First slice done
14. ~~Sound-quality comparison~~ ✅
15. **Batch comparison / benchmarking** ← next

---

# 16. Coding Guidelines

When generating code:

- Prefer simple vertical slices
- Do not over-engineer too early
- Keep DSP logic separate from UI
- Keep OpenAI logic separate from DSP logic
- Keep Python sidecar isolated
- Do not hardcode fake metrics
- Do not fabricate AI findings
- Do not silently choose scientific formulas without documenting assumptions
- Add tests for calculation logic
- Add tests for data contracts
- Use clear names understandable to acoustic engineers
- Make analysis parameters explicit
- Handle errors clearly
- Avoid introducing large dependencies without explaining why
- Ask or add a TODO when a scientific choice is ambiguous

### Important Rule

If a calculation, standard, or algorithm is not clearly specified, do not pretend it is known.

Instead: add a clearly marked assumption, add a TODO, ask for confirmation, or implement a minimal clearly documented version.

```csharp
// TODO: Confirm whether CPB should follow IEC 61260 exact band definitions.
// Current implementation uses nominal 1/3-octave center frequencies.
```

### Project Conventions (observed)

- Backend uses FastEndpoints pattern (Command → Handler → Endpoint)
- Frontend uses feature-folder structure with Redux slices per feature
- API client in `src/shared/api/`
- SCSS modules for component styling
- Mantine components as the design system
- Canvas-based custom rendering for performance-critical visualizations

---

# 17. Agent Validation Rules

The agent must follow these rules:

1. It can only explain evidence provided by backend
2. It must not invent frequencies, levels, metrics, or causes
3. It must include uncertainty when needed
4. It must distinguish measured facts from hypotheses
5. It must suggest next steps based on evidence
6. It should be concise but useful
7. It should be understandable to non-experts when requested
8. It should be technical enough for engineers when requested

---

# 18. Innovation Direction

The product becomes disruptive when it moves beyond plotting.

Prioritize features that help users:

- Understand sound faster
- Compare many products
- Detect important differences
- Explain findings to others
- Generate evidence-based reports
- Decide what to test next

The future product should feel like:

> "An acoustic engineer sitting next to me, helping me investigate."

Not:

> "A chat box that guesses things about audio."

# 20. Immediate Recommended Sprint Goal

Sprint goal:

> Add sound-quality comparison evidence on top of the first loudness/sharpness/roughness metrics layer.

Suggested scope:

```
Use the implemented MoSQITo loudness/sharpness/roughness sidecar
→ run metrics for compared files or selected regions
→ return loudness/sharpness/roughness deltas with method metadata and limitations
→ surface deltas in the comparison UI
→ let agent compare/report artifacts cite only measured sound-quality evidence
→ keep calibration caveats explicit until physical SPL calibration exists
```

Findings, tonal peak detection, the first CPB graph slice, CPB comparison, CPB weighting controls, the experimental `python_filter_bank` sidecar path, generated-WAV CPB validation tests, the first MoSQITo loudness/sharpness/roughness slice, sound-quality comparison deltas, the full agent findings investigation flow (run_findings → findings_result + tool_result workspace artifacts, evidence citation pills, referenced context panel, markdown rendering), and Python package installation are all now implemented. The next high-value task is batch benchmarking, because it turns single-file and A/B workflows into product-family ranking, clustering, outlier detection, and report generation.

---

# 21. Product North Star

The long-term north star is:

> AcousticGPT helps engineers understand, compare, and improve sound faster by combining trustworthy DSP, batch benchmarking, and evidence-based AI investigation.

Every feature should support that direction.
